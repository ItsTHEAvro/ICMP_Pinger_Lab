   ```bash
   python ICMP_Pinger_Gui.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the application, and you'll see a window with an input field for the host (IP or domain).
2. Enter a valid host (e.g., `google.com`) in the input field.
3. Click the "Start Ping" button to begin pinging the host. The results will appear in the text box below.
4. To stop the pinging, click the "Stop Ping" button. The statistics, including packet loss, RTT min/avg/max, and the number of packets sent/received, will be displayed in the result section.

Example usage:

- Enter `google.com` in the "Enter Host" field and press "Start Ping".
- View the ping results with RTT and TTL.
- Stop the pinging anytime and see statistics.

## Features

- **Real-time Ping Results**: View live ping responses with RTT and TTL for each packet sent.
- **Packet Loss**: See the percentage of packet loss while pinging the host.
- **Min/Avg/Max RTT**: The round-trip time (RTT) statistics are displayed, including minimum, average, and maximum values.
- **Error Handling**: Friendly error messages for DNS resolution failures or unreachable hosts.
- **Stop and Statistics**: You can stop the ping process and get detailed statistics like packets sent/received and RTT values.
